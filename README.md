I created this Public Vehicle Registry for anyone to use. All fields must be filled in, and the more detail that is written, then the easier it will be to confront the perpetrator. Users post anonymously, but IP addresses are collected to prevent spammers from filling the database with irrelevant entries. I hope with this system we are able to protect one another.
